# 🕹️ Think & Trade – Candle Price Simulator

A simple, interactive trading simulator built with **HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It generates a real-time random-walk price chart (candlesticks) and lets users:

- **Buy (Long)**
- **Sell (Short)**
- **Close Position**
- Track **Unrealized** and **Realized P/L**
- Control candle speed (1s → fast mode)
- Adjust **Position Size** and **Leverage**

This project is designed for beginners learning the basics of market movement, trade entry/exit, and risk management — in a **fun, risk-free game environment**.
